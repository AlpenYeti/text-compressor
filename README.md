# TEXT COMPRESSOR

This project has been driven by Josselin PEREZ as a study on sorting and compression algorithms.
It splits the text into trigrams and turns them into shorter expressions.

This version is able to compress texts with up to 7544 trigrams.

## COMPRESSION
```
python compression_text.py <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>
```

## DECOMPRESSION
